# TypeScript solutions to LeetCode problems

## Quickstart

First, install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Then, run unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io):

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Runtime Environment

- TypeScript 4.5.4, Node.js 167.13.2.
- Your code is run with `--harmony` flag, enabling [new ES6 features](http://node.green/).
- [lodash.js](https://lodash.com/) library is included by default.
- For Priority Queue / Queue data structures, you may use version 4.1 [datastructures-js/priority-queue](https://github.com/datastructures-js/priority-queue) and [datastructures-js/queue](https://github.com/datastructures-js/queue).

## TODOs

- [x] Parameterized testing with Jest
- [x] Add support for loading test cases from YAML files
- [ ] Add support for building and testing with Bazel
- [ ] Try Gazelle to see if we can generate `BUILD` files automatically
